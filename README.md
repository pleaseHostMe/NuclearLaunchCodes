## NuclearLaunchCodes

A small Node.js server that serves a single, very curious image.

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or, during development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Begin the puzzle**

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

   - The interface is minimal on purpose.
   - The image at `/puzzle.png` is the important part.

Nothing else here will tell you what it means.
